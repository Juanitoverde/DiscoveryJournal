You could say I'm a fortune reader, not a fortune teller. 

I can't tell you how long you'll have a fortune, but I can definetly read what has made you a fortune...

Lets traversal our way back to 2008 where file systems were free, and insecure... shipexec.com ...

Well before I begin, I'd like to simply put, I couldn't find any bug bountys for this part of UPS. It doesn't fall under the bug bounty I can find easily.

This is the closest one:

https://hackerone.com/ups/

It obviously doesn't cover its other sites such as Connect Ship or Ship Exec, etc..

I've attempted to reach out to different emails over at UPS but nothing. So I apologize for any feelings hurt, or moods disrupted, but maybe you spend part of that
$186.5 billion dollar evaluation towards your companies security. All aspects, all corners, and all areas of your companies security...


So now lets get to it.

I first came across shipexec.com after looking into other companies owned by UPS wondering how extensive their reach is besides just "The UPS Store" brand is.
It brought me to, https://www.shipexec.com/

We can safely assume they are UPS in every way shape or form.

So what am I doing here? To learn. To wonder, and I do that frequently. What's first? Maybe I should take it slow, not break anything accidently and become
the persistent a-hole we all know to well, who will just keep seeing how bad it gets before I can't fix the damage.

Oh,
Lovely, documentation. I do need some new reading material: https://www.shipexec.com/Info
