Dear, {name of franchise(s) & Owners}

    The Corporate behind you, overseeing everything you do, taxing everything they can, who has disappointed you endlessly; needs to wake up and ensure your
    business is as secure as their salary and profit margins are. I am writing this to make everyone aware how important security is, and how important
    every aspect of your business is when it involves security. This includes business partners, relations, and any affiliates.
    
    To all Franchise Owner(s), there are a few amazing things that I respect from each and every one of you. You are all Small Buisnesses
    making your footprint in this world. You are helping a community, that helps serve a the bigger picture in the ever-growing world.
    You are bigger then anyone realizes, even bigger then the Corporate realizes. So why are they not taking the same steps they take
    to secure themselves? Why do they not make the same financial investment into your security? A semi-annual District Manager
    handing over a few PDF Documents via e-Mail is not the investment you deserve.
    
    You pay royalties, you pay for the clothing your employees wear, you pay for software usage, you pay for everything, from the computers
    you use, to the branding on your back, you put their brand on the property you rent just to have a store. The costs that purely
    benefit corporate aren't ever put back into your community, they're not put back into your stores. No, they're put into the
    current $160B net worth evaluation, into the pockets of those who don't know what it is to serve a community on a day to day
    basis.
    
    This write up isn't for me, or you store Owners. I'm not doing this to make myself feel as I have helped anyone out. I am not writing this to
    feel as if I did a justice for store owners. I'm writing this to show how franchises can ruin a Corporation, as fast as they built the franchise name.
    How maybe, just maybe... Putting money into these franchises, should be a main point of focus for your security, and for the security of your 
    Corporation overall. Remember, The Bigger They Are, The Harder They Fall...
    
    I'll leave this last comment as I finish the full write up, A Chain is Only as Strong as It's Weakest Link. Don't forget about the franchise chains, Mr. Corporate.
    
    
                                                       Forever Yours,
                                                              The Negative Man Who Just Wants Positive Changes
