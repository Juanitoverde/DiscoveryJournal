I have discovered a few fatal flaws in a specific website. This website isn't some small time Cowboy in this Wild Wild West.

I will be documenting my research here. This is to show how turning a blind eye to bad security habbits for 20+ years, will ensure 
everyone around you doesn't see the flaws hiding in plain site.

I will go over a few PoC's I am working on, A few vital information disclosures, and overall the countless security mistakes 
no body should make.

This will be updated serveral times, until I have covered everything in depth. The more I uncover, the worse it gets,
so I assume I will have to start this somewhere.

====================

1) There is no reason to show or provde ACCOUNT INFORMATION (even if that password is hashed...) just by a single HTTP Request...

2) 1 Cookie Shouldn't be a 'VIP' Ticket backstage to EVERYONES Information. Especially when that Cookie isn't even an authenticated one.

3) An Account Policy containing Password / Security Rules, or (sad I have to say this..) SECURITY QUESTIONS, Owners Registration Information... & MORE.
should not displayed or presented in such a way where it is open for the whole world to see...

4) How security questions have answers, but those answers shouldn't be accessible or even viewable in plain text to anyone other then the user who made them.

5) If admin:password wasn't secure, _GUEST:PASSWORD probably isn't either. 

6) How a _GUEST can access your FTP Servers, and view sensitive information of your customers. 

7) How does trust effect a stock.

8) A Security Policy, Enforcing Mixed Cases, Special Chars, Numbers, etc.. Should Be REQUIRED FOR EVERY ACCOUNT. NOT JUST 2 out of 5600+ 
(are the other 5558 accounts just not good enough? If thwa was the case, why are admn accounts using 1+1 as a security question, but required to have a strict
password policy?)
