# DiscoveryJournal
A place where I attempt to provide interesting and detailed discoveries in a journal / blog type manner. I will only post things I have discovered on my own, not saying these haven't been discovered by others. These entries are for my own personal development and record. I will always reference and give credit when credit is due, ripping off content isn't my cup of tea.
